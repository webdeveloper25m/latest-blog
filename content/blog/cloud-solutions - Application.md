Every organization is unique and their requirement too. When it comes to cloud, finding the simplified solution from the available tons of options enables customers to adapt fast through modularity and dynamically scale in and out in secured manner is the key. web and mobile application which can deployed in AWS, or private cloud service.

Cloud application servers typically are located in a remote data center operated by a third-party cloud services infrastructure provider. Cloud-based application tasks may encompass email, file storage and sharing, order entry, inventory management, word processing, customer relationship management (CRM), data collection, or financial accounting features.

Benefits of cloud apps
Fast response to business needs. Cloud applications can be updated, tested and deployed quickly, providing enterprises with fast time to market and agility. This speed can lead to culture shifts in business operations.

Simplified operation. Infrastructure management can be outsourced to third-party cloud providers.

Instant scalability. As demand rises or falls, available capacity can be adjusted.

API use. Third-party data sources and storage services can be accessed with an application programming interface (API). Cloud applications can be kept smaller by using APIs to hand data to applications or API-based back-end services for processing or analytics computations, with the results handed back to the cloud application. Vetted APIs impose passive consistency that can speed development and yield predictable results.

Gradual adoption. Refactoring legacy, on-premises applications to a cloud architecture in steps, allows components to be implemented on a gradual basis.

Reduced costs. The size and scale of data centers run by major cloud infrastructure and service providers, along with competition among providers, has led to lower prices. Cloud-based applications can be less expensive to operate and maintain than equivalents on-premises installation.

Improved data sharing and security. Data stored on cloud services is instantly available to authorized users. Due to their massive scale, cloud providers can hire world-class security experts and implement infrastructure security measures that typically only large enterprises can obtain. Centralized data managed by IT operations personnel is more easily backed up on a regular schedule and restored should disaster recovery become necessary.

How cloud apps work
Data is stored and compute cycles occur in a remote data center typically operated by a third-party company. A back end ensures uptime, security and integration and supports multiple access methods.

Cloud applications provide quick responsiveness and don't need to permanently reside on the local device. They can function offline, but can be updated online.

While under constant control, cloud applications don't always consume storage space on a computer or communications device. Assuming a reasonably fast internet connection, a well-written cloud application offers all the interactivity of a desktop application, along with the portability of a web application.

Cloud apps vs. web apps
With the advancement of remote computing technology, clear lines between cloud and web applications have blurred. The term cloud application has gained great cachet, sometimes leading application vendors with any online aspect to brand them as cloud applications.

Cloud and web applications access data residing on distant storage. Both use server processing power that may be located on premises or in a distant data center.

A key difference between cloud and web applications is architecture. A web application or web-based application must have a continuous internet connection to function. Conversely, a cloud application or cloud-based application performs processing tasks on a local computer or workstation. An internet connection is required primarily for downloading or uploading data.

A web application is unusable if the remote server is unavailable. If the remote server becomes unavailable in a cloud application, the software installed on the local user device can still operate, although it cannot upload and download data until service at the remote server is restored.
