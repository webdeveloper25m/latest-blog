SD WAN

SD-WAN is a software-defined approach to improve applications performance, increasing agility and reducing costs with transport independence connection types
SD-WAN simplifies the management and operation of a WAN by decoupling the networking hardware from its control mechanism.

A Software-defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) is a virtual WAN architecture that allows enterprises to leverage any combination of transport services – including MPLS, LTE and broadband internet services – to securely connect users to applications an SD-WAN uses a centralized control function to securely intelligently direct traffic across the WAN This increases application performance. and delivers a high quality user experience. resulting in increased business productivity, agility and reduced costs for IT.

This quick explainer video explains what SD-WAN is and why you need it.

An SD-WAN securely connects users to any application, whether hosted in the data center or in the cloud across any WAN transport service including broadband internet services.

Traditional WANs based on conventional routers were never designed for the cloud. They typically require backhauling all traffic – including cloud- destined traffic – from branch offices to a hub or headquarters data center where advanced security inspection services can be applied. The delay caused by backhaul impairs application performance resulting in a poor user experience and lost productivity.

Unlike the traditional router-centric WAN architecture, the SD-WAN model is designed to fully support applications hosted in on-premise data centers, public or private clouds and SaaS services such as Salesforce.com, Workday, Office 365 and Dropbox, while delivering the highest levels of application performance.

How Does an SD-WAN Work?
An SD-WAN enables cloud-first enterprises to deliver a superior application quality of experience (QoEX) for users. Using intelligence and by identifying applications, an SD-WAN provides application-aware routing across the WAN. Each class of applications receives the appropriate QoS and security policy enforcement, all in accordance with business needs.

Secure local internet breakout of IaaS and SaaS application traffic from the branch provides the highest levels of cloud performance while protecting the enterprise from threats. Unlike SD-WAN, the conventional router-centric model distributes the control function across all devices in the network and simply routes traffic based on TCP/IP addresses and ACLs. This model tends to be rigid, inefficient and not cloud-friendly, resulting in a poor user experience.

This video explains how SD-WAN works and highlights how it defers from hardware-based, device-centric WANs based on traditional routers.
