Sass

Sass is a style sheet language initially designed by Hampton Catlin and developed by Natalie Weizenbaum. After its initial versions, Weizenbaum and Chris Eppstein have continued to extend Sass with SassScript, a scripting language used in Sass files


If you’re looking for an introduction to Sass,<a href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation">check out the tutorial</a>.

If you want to look up a built-in Sass function, look no further than the built-in module reference.

If you’re calling Sass from JavaScript, you may want the JS API documentation.

Or the Dart API documentation if you’re calling it from Dart.

Otherwise, use the table of contents for the language reference
